## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Create your branch from `master`.
1. Write your code.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!
